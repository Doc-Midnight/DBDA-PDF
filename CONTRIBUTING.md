This repository is the GitHub home for my **brms**/**tidyverse** translation of Kruschke's [*Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan*](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/). You can find the current HTML version of my translation at [https://bookdown.org/content/3686/](https://bookdown.org/content/3686/).

This project is something of a living document and I welcome corrections, suggestions, and solutions to any of the problems I have yet to fully work out. 

## Code of conduct

I don't care if you come off as professional or not, but please try to be kind.

## *I just have a question*.

I do not have a high enough question volume to need a formal question policy, at this time. I prefer it when people ask questions in an open format, such as in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues), as a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz) post, or on the [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/interfaces/brms/36). That way others can (a) chime in and (b) benefit from the discussion. Other approaches, such as in personal emails, are fine. However, I reserve the right to respond at my own pace.

## *I would like to contribute*.

Great! I'm guessing most contributions will fall under:

* reporting typos, code breaks (e.g., [here](https://github.com/ASKurz/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues/23)), and hyperlink breaks;
* reporting errors in the code;
* responding to requests for help either in the GitHub issues section (e.g., [here](https://github.com/ASKurz/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues/22)) or in the ebook itself (e.g., in the middle of  [Section 4.3.4.](https://bookdown.org/content/3686/what-is-this-stuff-called-probability.html#highest-density-interval-hdi.)); or
* requesting features (e.g., [here](https://github.com/ASKurz/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues/7)).

I generally prefer people use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ASKurz/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-in-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues) for these. However, it's okay if you would like to make a pull request. Beware that PR's tend to make me nervous and I'm more likely to avoid them in favor of responding to the issues. Sometimes it makes sense to correspond with me by email, but I ask you use that as a last option.

## Code style

I generally follow the recommendations in [*The tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but I have a few quirky conventions of my own. If you plan on recommending a big chunk of code, **tidyverse** conventions are generally preferred.

## Credit

I make it a practice to thank my contributors in the `index.Rmd` files of all my ebooks. You can find the list in the current version at [https://bookdown.org/content/3686/index.html#thank-yous-are-in-order](https://bookdown.org/content/3686/index.html#thank-yous-are-in-order). If your contribution ends up in the ebook, I'll happily add your name and GitHub handle to the list. If for some reason you don't want to be added to the list, please let me know and I'll respect your privacy. 

Every once in a while, someone helps with a substantial contribution. In those cases, I like to give shout outs right in the body of the text. For example Ph.Demetri, Lukas Neugebauer, and Brenton Wiernik collectively helped me with a math-stats equation that solved a series of translation difficulties in [Chapter 23](https://bookdown.org/content/3686/ordinal-predicted-variable.html). Just like my stance for smaller contributions, I'm happy to leave your name out of the text if you prefer your privacy.
