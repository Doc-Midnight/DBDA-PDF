# DBDA-PDF
This is my current repository for A. Solomon Kurz's work *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis in* `brms` *and the* `tidyverse` (v 0.4.0). His work is fantastic, but for any number of reasons (many of which I think I found), he does not make his work available in PDF form. Since I *really* don't like reading technical material online, I used his files to create an approrpriate PDF version - this is it. 

I've made a series of minor changes, none of which affect the code or the mathematical results; they are mostly typographical (or LaTeX-related). 

If there are differences between this version and the version that Kurz maintains, *his is the correct version*. I tried to ensure that I didn't introduce any errors, but trust him - not me.
